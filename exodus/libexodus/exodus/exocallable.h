/*
WARNING this documentation is from BEFORE adding enabling call of objects in external libraries
using programinit/exit and libraryinit/exit.

Traditionally, mv functions and subroutines are implemented as separately compilable units
and there is only one function or subroutine per compilation unit (file/record).

the only difference between functions and subroutines is that functions return a value whereas
subroutines do not. Both functions and subroutines can be called with any number of arguments
including none.

exodus implements mv external functions and subroutines as C++ callables in shared libraries loaded
on demand/just in time.

=== example ===

imagine we want a subroutine called "subr3" that takes one argument (and returns nothing)

we decide that "subr3" will be in a library (ie a single compilable file/record) called "lib1"

==== library lib1.cpp ====

#include <exodus/library.h>
libraryinit()
function main(in var1) {
	printl("lib1 says " ^ var1);
}
libraryexit()

==== lib1.h ====

This header file is generated AUTOMATICALLY by the command "compile lib1"

==== program call1.cpp ====

To use the function all we have to do is include the lib1.h file. The library
binary is automatically loaded the first time that the function is called.

#include <exodus/program.h>
programinit()
#include <lib1.h>
function main (){
 call lib1("xyz");
}
programexit()

==== sample session ====

compile lib1
compile call1
call1
lib1 says xyz

=== Exodus Library Concept ===

exodus allows multiple functions and subroutines in a particular file using the following syntax

This is currently only used to provide c++ dictionary functions at the moment
but the machinery would be similar for multi-function libraries.

e.g. in a file dict1.cpp

#include <exodus/dict.h>
dictinit(aaa)
...
dictexit(aaa)

dictinit(bbb)
...
dictexit(bbb)

	/*
		Note: We will be using the following pointer to member function to call
		member functions (in shared libraries) that have different arguments.

		ISO C++ doesnt support casting between member function pointers unless they are "similar".

		But many C++ compilers relax this rule, as a non-standard language extension,
		to allow wrong-type access through the inactive member of a union.
		Such access is not undefined in C.
		https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Cast-to-Union.html#Cast-to-Union

		This has worked in gcc and clang 2000 to date (2022) and worked in msvc at least 2000-2015
		using a c-style cast. Broad and long standing compiler support is unlikely to be revoked.
		It also works with reinterpret_cast in gcc and clang 2022.

		So we will be getting the following warning which will have to ignored.

		warning: cast between incompatible pointer to member types from
		‘exo::pExodusProgramBaseMemberFunction’ {aka ‘exo::var (exo::ExodusProgramBase::*)()’} to
		        ‘pExodusProgramBaseMemberFunction’ {aka ‘exo::var (exo::ExodusProgramBase::*)(const exo::var&)’}

		We can ignore such warnings using something like [-Wcast-function-type] in gcc and clang.

		TODO Reimplement as a call to a global function in the shared library.
